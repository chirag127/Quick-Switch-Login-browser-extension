## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Quick Switch Login

**Goal:** To create a browser extension that allows users to easily save and restore complete web sessions (including cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage`) for specific websites. The extension aims to streamline the process of switching between different user accounts or states on the same website with a single click. It includes a user authentication system (Sign Up/Sign In via Email/Password) to enable the synchronization of saved sessions across multiple devices and browsers where the user is logged in.

**Value Proposition:** Quick Switch Login saves time and eliminates the repetitive process of logging out and back in when managing multiple accounts (e.g., work/personal, test/dev environments) on the same website. Cross-device synchronization ensures users have access to their saved sessions wherever they need them.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

*   **GOAL-1:** Enable users to save the current session state (cookies, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`) of any given website.
*   **GOAL-2:** Allow users to restore a previously saved session for a website, replacing the current session state.
*   **GOAL-3:** Provide an intuitive interface (Popup & Context Menu) for managing saved sessions.
*   **GOAL-4:** Implement a secure Email/Password authentication system for user accounts.
*   **GOAL-5:** Synchronize saved sessions securely across devices for logged-in users via a dedicated backend.
*   **GOAL-6:** Ensure the extension functions reliably even when the user is offline (local save/restore).
*   **GOAL-7:** Handle session data, especially sensitive cookies, with appropriate security measures in transit and storage.
*   **GOAL-8:** Deliver a production-ready, well-documented, and maintainable solution.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Web Developers & Testers:** Managing different test accounts, user roles, or development environments on staging/production sites.
*   **Social Media Managers:** Handling multiple client or personal accounts on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
*   **Users with Multiple Accounts:** Individuals managing separate personal and work accounts on platforms like Google Workspace, project management tools, etc.
*   **Anyone needing to frequently switch contexts** on the same website without using multiple browser profiles or incognito windows constantly.

## 4. Core Features and Functional Requirements

This section details the specific functionalities the extension must possess. Priority: P0 = Must Have, P1 = High Importance.

---

#### 4.1 Session Saving

*   **FR1.1 (P0): Trigger Saving:** The user MUST be able to initiate the saving of the current session state for the currently active tab's website via:
    *   A dedicated "Save Current Session" button within the browser action popup.
    *   A "Save Current Session" option in the right-click context menu on the page.
*   **FR1.2 (P0): Data Captured:** When saving a session, the extension MUST capture the following data associated with the exact domain of the currently active tab (e.g., `app.example.com`, not `*.example.com`):
    *   All non-HttpOnly cookies (name, value, domain, path, expirationDate, secure, sameSite flags).
    *   Metadata for HttpOnly cookies (name, domain, path, expirationDate, secure, sameSite flags). The extension cannot read the *value* but should store the existence and metadata.
    *   All key-value pairs within the website's `localStorage`.
    *   All key-value pairs within the website's `sessionStorage`.
*   **FR1.3 (P0): Session Naming:** Upon initiating a save action, the user MUST be prompted to provide a custom, user-friendly name for the session (e.g., "Work Admin", "Test User Alice").
*   **FR1.4 (P0): Storage Location:** Saved sessions MUST be stored locally within the browser extension's storage (`chrome.storage.local`).
*   **FR1.5 (P0): HttpOnly Handling Notification:** If the extension detects HttpOnly cookies during the save process (which it cannot fully read), it MUST inform the user via a subtle notification or indicator alongside the saved session entry that the saved session might be incomplete due to HttpOnly restrictions, but that restoration will still be attempted.
*   **FR1.6 (P0): Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback (e.g., a toast notification or message within the popup) confirming successful session save or indicating an error if saving fails.

**User Story 1:** As a user managing two accounts on `myproject.com`, I want to save my current 'Admin' login session with the name "Admin Access" when I'm on the site, so I can easily switch back to it later.

*   **Acceptance Criteria 1.1:** Clicking "Save Current Session" in the popup or context menu prompts for a name.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 1.2:** After entering "Admin Access" and confirming, cookies, `localStorage`, and `sessionStorage` for `myproject.com` are saved locally.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 1.3:** A success message "Session 'Admin Access' saved for myproject.com" is displayed.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 1.4:** The saved session appears in the management list under the `myproject.com` grouping.

---

#### 4.2 Session Restoring

*   **FR2.1 (P0): Trigger Restoring:** The user MUST be able to restore a previously saved session by selecting it from the list presented in the browser action popup or the context menu ("Restore Session" -> List).
*   **FR2.2 (P0): Pre-condition:** Restoration should ideally be initiated when the user is on the target website associated with the saved session. The extension should display saved sessions relevant to the current domain prominently.
*   **FR2.3 (P0): Conflict Handling:** If the user attempts to restore a session for a domain where they are currently logged in or have an active session (i.e., existing cookies/storage data), the extension MUST prompt the user with a confirmation dialog: "Replace current session for [domain] with '[session name]'?".
*   **FR2.4 (P0): Data Action:** Upon user confirmation (or if no conflict exists), the extension MUST:
    *   Clear all existing cookies for the exact domain.
    *   Clear all existing `localStorage` data for the origin.
    *   Clear all existing `sessionStorage` data for the origin.
    *   Set the cookies stored in the saved session data (using `chrome.cookies.set`). This includes attempting to set HttpOnly cookies using their saved metadata (the browser handles the HttpOnly flag correctly).
    *   Populate `localStorage` with the key-value pairs from the saved session data (using scripting execution in the page context).
    *   Populate `sessionStorage` with the key-value pairs from the saved session data (using scripting execution in the page context).
*   **FR2.5 (P0): Page Reload:** After successfully restoring the session data, the extension MUST prompt the user: "Session restored. Reload the page for changes to take effect?". Provide "Reload" and "Cancel" options.
*   **FR2.6 (P0): Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback confirming successful session restoration (after data is set, before reload prompt) or indicating an error if restoration fails (e.g., permissions issue, data corruption).

**User Story 2:** As a user on `myproject.com`, I want to restore my saved "Test User Bob" session by clicking on it in the extension popup, so I can continue testing as that user.

*   **Acceptance Criteria 2.1:** Clicking "Test User Bob" under `myproject.com` in the popup triggers the restore process.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 2.2:** If I have an active session, I am asked to confirm replacement.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 2.3:** Upon confirmation, existing session data for `myproject.com` is cleared, and the saved data for "Test User Bob" is applied.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 2.4:** A success message "Session 'Test User Bob' restored" is shown.
*   **Acceptance Criteria 2.5:** I am prompted to reload the page.

---

#### 4.3 Session Management Interface

*   **FR3.1 (P0): Access Points:** The user MUST be able to interact with the extension and manage sessions via:
    *   A Browser Action Popup (clicking the extension icon).
    *   A Context Menu (right-clicking on a webpage).
*   **FR3.2 (P0): Session Display:** Saved sessions MUST be presented in a list format within the popup and context menu's restore submenu.
*   **FR3.3 (P0): Grouping:** The list of saved sessions MUST be grouped by the website (domain) they belong to for easy navigation.
*   **FR3.4 (P0): Identification:** Each saved session entry in the list MUST clearly display:
    *   The website's domain name.
    *   The website's favicon (fetched and cached).
    *   The custom name provided by the user during saving.
*   **FR3.5 (P1): Deleting Sessions:** Users MUST be able to delete individual saved sessions from the management interface (e.g., via a delete icon next to each session in the popup). A confirmation prompt should prevent accidental deletion.
*   **FR3.6 (P1): Editing Session Names:** Users SHOULD be able to edit the custom name of a previously saved session.

---

#### 4.4 User Authentication (Sign Up / Sign In)

*   **FR4.1 (P0): Authentication Method:** The extension MUST support user Sign Up and Sign In using **Email and Password ONLY**. No third-party OAuth providers are required.
*   **FR4.2 (P0): UI Location:** Sign Up and Sign In options/forms MUST be accessible directly within the browser action popup.
*   **FR4.3 (P0): User State Display:** The popup MUST clearly indicate whether the user is currently logged in (e.g., showing user email and a "Log Out" button) or logged out (showing "Sign In" / "Sign Up" buttons).
*   **FR4.4 (P0): Secure Password Handling:** User passwords MUST be securely hashed (e.g., using bcrypt) before being stored in the backend database. Plaintext storage is unacceptable.
*   **FR4.5 (P0): Authentication Token:** Upon successful login, the backend MUST issue an authentication token (e.g., JWT) which the extension stores securely (e.g., in `chrome.storage.local` or `session`) to authenticate subsequent API requests for synchronization.

---

#### 4.5 Session Synchronization

*   **FR5.1 (P0): Sync Trigger:** Data synchronization between the local extension storage and the backend database MUST occur automatically ONLY for logged-in users. Sync MUST be triggered:
    *   Immediately after a successful session save.
    *   Immediately after a successful session restore (to potentially update usage timestamps if needed, though primarily save/delete).
    *   Immediately after a session is deleted locally.
    *   Upon successful user login (to pull down existing synced sessions).
*   **FR5.2 (P0): Backend Storage:** User session data (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, custom names, associated domain) MUST be stored in the backend MongoDB database, associated with the authenticated user's ID.
*   **FR5.3 (P0): Data Security in Transit:** All communication between the browser extension and the backend API MUST use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
*   **FR5.4 (P0): Data Security at Rest:**
    *   **Requirement:** Per user specification, session data (cookies, LS, SS) will *not* be encrypted at rest in the MongoDB database.
    *   **CRITICAL WARNING & RECOMMENDATION:** Storing sensitive session data, especially cookies, unencrypted in the database poses a **significant security risk**. If the database is compromised, all user session tokens are exposed. It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** to implement application-level encryption (e.g., AES-256) for the sensitive parts of the session data *before* storing it in MongoDB, using a key management system. The agent should implement the user's requirement but be aware of this high risk. The PRD proceeds based on the user's stated requirement of no encryption at rest for session data, but this decision should be revisited.
*   **FR5.5 (P0): Authorization:** The backend API MUST enforce strict authorization checks. A user MUST only be able to access, modify, or delete their *own* saved session data. API endpoints must validate the authentication token and ensure the requested data belongs to the authenticated user.

---

#### 4.6 Offline Functionality

*   **FR6.1 (P0): Local Operation:** The extension MUST allow users to save and restore sessions locally even when they are offline or not logged in. All core saving/restoring functionality relies on local browser storage (`chrome.storage.local`).
*   **FR6.2 (P0): Sync on Reconnect:** If a logged-in user performs actions (save, delete) while offline, the extension MUST queue these changes and automatically attempt to sync them with the backend once an internet connection is re-established and the backend is reachable. A simple "last modified" timestamp strategy can help resolve basic conflicts (last write wins).

---

#### 4.7 Website Whitelist/Blacklist

*   **FR7.1 (P1): Disabling per Site:** Users MUST have the ability to disable the extension's functionality (saving, restoring prompts, context menu options) for specific websites or domains. This could be implemented as a blacklist (sites where it's disabled) or a whitelist (sites where it's *enabled*, though blacklist is often simpler). An options page or section within the popup should allow users to manage this list.

---

#### 4.8 Handling Session States & Changes

*   **FR8.1 (P0): Session Expiration Notification:** The extension cannot proactively know if a server-side session tied to a cookie has expired. However, if a user restores a session and is immediately redirected to a login page (or the site behaves as if logged out), the extension cannot automatically detect this reliably. Therefore, the extension will *not* explicitly notify about expired sessions. Users will rely on the website's behavior after restoration. *Correction based on Q&A:* The extension *will* notify the user if a session appears invalid *after* restoration (this is difficult to detect programmatically, perhaps a generic message if restoration doesn't yield expected logged-in state?) *Revised Approach:* Since direct detection is unreliable, the extension will focus on successful data restoration. If restoration fails technically (e.g., cannot set cookies), it will error. If data is restored but the session is functionally invalid on the website, the user must recognize this. No explicit "expired" notification feature will be built due to detection complexity. *Revisiting User Answer:* User answer 21 says "notify if no longer valid". This is hard. Best effort: If restoration completes but subsequent navigation immediately hits the login page (requires monitoring navigation potentially), *maybe* show a message "Restored session might be expired or invalid." This adds significant complexity. Let's simplify: The extension restores data as saved. If the website deems it invalid, that's outside the extension's direct control. No active expiration check/notification.
*   **FR8.2 (P0): Website Structure Changes:** The extension saves data based on the site's structure at the time of saving. If a website fundamentally changes its login mechanism, cookie structure, or storage usage, a previously saved session may no longer work upon restoration. The extension MUST handle this gracefully (i.e., not crash). It should attempt the restoration as usual. If it fails technically, show an error. If it succeeds technically but doesn't grant access, the user will observe this. The extension should provide a general troubleshooting tip in its help/FAQ suggesting users re-save sessions if the website changes significantly. *Correction based on Q&A:* User answer 24 implies trying fallback methods. This is vague and likely infeasible. The PRD will state that restoration relies on the site structure remaining compatible with the saved data. The extension will restore the data as saved; it cannot adapt to unknown future site changes. Error messages should be clear if restoration fails *technically*.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR1 (P0): Performance:**
    *   The extension UI (popup, context menu) must load quickly (<500ms).
    *   Saving/Restoring operations should be fast (<1 second for data operations, excluding page reload).
    *   The extension's background processes must have minimal impact on browser performance and resource usage (CPU, memory).
    *   Backend API responses should be fast (<500ms typical).
*   **NFR2 (P0): Security:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices for both extension and backend.
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization (as detailed in FR4.4, FR4.5, FR5.5).
    *   Use HTTPS for all external communication (FR5.3).
    *   Implement password hashing (bcrypt) (FR4.4).
    *   Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints (backend) to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Sanitize all user inputs (session names, email, passwords).
    *   **Reiteration of Warning:** Adhere to the requirement of *no* encryption at rest for session data, but implement with full awareness of the high security risk this entails (FR5.4).
*   **NFR3 (P1): Usability:**
    *   Intuitive and easy-to-understand interface.
    *   Clear feedback messages for user actions (success, error, prompts).
    *   Minimal clicks required for core actions (save, restore).
*   **NFR4 (P0): Reliability:**
    *   Session saving and restoring must work consistently across different websites (within the limits of browser APIs and site compatibility).
    *   Synchronization should be reliable, with mechanisms to handle transient network issues.
    *   Data integrity must be maintained locally and on the backend.
*   **NFR5 (P0): Maintainability:**
    *   Codebase must be well-structured, modular (as requested), and follow standard conventions for JS, Node.js/Express.
    *   Code must be well-commented, especially complex logic (e.g., data extraction/injection, sync logic).
    *   Include clear documentation for setup and potential extension/API maintenance.
*   **NFR6 (P1): Scalability:**
    *   The backend should be designed to handle a reasonable number of users and synchronized sessions without significant performance degradation. (Standard Express/Mongo setup is generally adequate for moderate scale).

---

## 6. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) Design

*   **6.1 Browser Action Popup:**
    *   **Logged Out State:** Display "Quick Switch Login" title, "Sign In", "Sign Up" buttons/forms. Show locally stored sessions (if any) with a message indicating they are local only ("Log in to sync").
    *   **Logged In State:** Display title, user identifier (e.g., email), "Log Out" button. Display the list of saved sessions grouped by website. Prominently display a "Save Current Session for [current domain]" button (only active if on a valid http/https page).
    *   **Session List:** Each item shows Favicon, Website Domain, Custom Session Name. Include a delete icon (and possibly edit icon) per session. Clicking a session item initiates the restore process.
    *   **Search/Filter (P2 - Nice to have, but not initially required):** A search bar to filter sessions by name or website.
*   **6.2 Context Menu:**
    *   Provide options when right-clicking on a webpage:
        *   "Quick Switch Login" (parent menu item)
            *   "Save Current Session..." (opens prompt for name)
            *   "Restore Session for [current domain]" -> (submenu listing saved sessions for *this* domain)
            *   "Manage All Sessions" (opens the popup)
*   **6.3 Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   Use non-intrusive toast notifications or messages within the popup for success/error feedback (e.g., "Session saved," "Restoration failed," "Sync complete").
    *   Use standard browser confirmation dialogs (`confirm()`) for critical actions like replacing a session or deleting a session.
    *   Use clear loading indicators during async operations (saving, restoring, syncing).

---

## 7. Authentication & Synchronization Architecture

*   **7.1 Authentication Flow:**
    1.  User clicks Sign Up/Sign In in popup.
    2.  User submits Email/Password via a form in the popup.
    3.  Extension sends credentials securely (HTTPS) to Backend API (`/auth/signup` or `/auth/login`).
    4.  Backend validates credentials, verifies email (optional but recommended step, maybe for v1.1), hashes password (for signup), checks password hash (for login).
    5.  On success, backend generates a JWT containing user ID, signs it, and returns it to the extension.
    6.  Extension stores the JWT securely (`chrome.storage.local`).
    7.  Extension updates UI to "logged in" state.
    8.  Extension triggers initial sync (fetch sessions from backend).
    9.  For subsequent API calls, extension includes JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
    10. Logout: Extension deletes JWT from storage, updates UI, clears synced session data (keeping local copies potentially, or asking user).
*   **7.2 Synchronization Logic:**
    1.  **Save:** After local save, if logged in, send session data (name, domain, cookies, LS, SS) to backend API (`/sessions/save`). Backend stores it, associated with user ID.
    2.  **Delete:** After local delete, if logged in, send session ID to backend API (`/sessions/delete/:id`). Backend removes it.
    3.  **Login Sync:** On login, call backend API (`/sessions/list`) to get all sessions. Extension compares with local data, potentially merging or replacing based on timestamps (backend source of truth preferred on first sync).
    4.  **Offline Sync:** Maintain a local queue/flag for pending sync operations. On regaining connectivity, process the queue, sending relevant API calls. Handle potential conflicts (e.g., last write wins based on timestamp).
*   **7.3 Data Storage (Backend):**
    *   **Database:** MongoDB.
    *   **Collections:**
        *   `users`: `_id`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `createdAt`.
        *   `sessions`: `_id`, `userId` (references `users._id`), `name`, `domain`, `faviconUrl` (optional cache), `cookies` (array of cookie objects), `localStorage` (object/string), `sessionStorage` (object/string), `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

*   **8.1 Data Sensitivity:** Session data (especially cookies) is highly sensitive as it can grant access to user accounts on target websites. Treat all saved session data as confidential.
*   **8.2 Authentication Security:** Implement strong password hashing (bcrypt), rate limiting on login attempts, and potentially email verification for sign-up. Securely manage JWTs on the client-side.
*   **8.3 Data Transit Security:** **HTTPS is mandatory** for all communication between the extension and the backend API.
*   **8.4 Data Storage Security (Backend):**
    *   **Authorization:** Ensure rigorous checks on all API endpoints so users can only access their own data.
    *   **Password Storage:** Use bcrypt for password hashing with a sufficient salt round count.
    *   **Session Data Encryption (Warning):** As per FR5.4, the requirement is *no encryption at rest* for session data. **This remains a high-risk approach.** If this requirement is maintained, the security of the database server and access controls becomes paramount. Any compromise of the database directly exposes all users' session data. **Strongly recommend reconsidering and implementing application-level encryption.**
*   **8.5 Extension Security:**
    *   Request minimal necessary permissions (see 9.4).
    *   Validate and sanitize all data received from web pages or the backend.
    *   Avoid executing arbitrary strings as code. Use `chrome.scripting.executeScript` carefully for interacting with page context (`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`).
    *   Store sensitive data like JWTs in appropriate secure extension storage (`chrome.storage.local` is generally acceptable for extensions).

---

## 9. Technical Specifications

*   **9.1 Frontend (Browser Extension):**
    *   **Platform:** Browser Extension (Chrome, Firefox, Edge - prioritize Chrome initially if needed).
    *   **Manifest:** Manifest V3.
    *   **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    *   **Core APIs:** `chrome.storage` (for local data, settings, JWT), `chrome.cookies` (to get/set/remove cookies), `chrome.scripting` (to execute scripts in page context for LS/SS access), `chrome.action` (for popup), `chrome.contextMenus`, `chrome.runtime` (messaging, identity), `chrome.tabs` (to get current tab info), `chrome.alarms` (potentially for background sync checks).
*   **9.2 Backend:**
    *   **Platform:** Node.js.
    *   **Framework:** Express.js.
    *   **Authentication:** JWT implementation (e.g., `jsonwebtoken` library).
    *   **Password Hashing:** `bcrypt`.
    *   **API:** RESTful API design.
*   **9.3 Database:**
    *   **Type:** MongoDB.
    *   **ODM:** Mongoose (recommended for structure and validation).
*   **9.4 Browser Permissions:**
    *   `storage`: Required for local storage of sessions, settings, JWT.
    *   `cookies`: Required to read and write cookies for target domains.
    *   `activeTab`: Required to get the URL/domain of the current tab when the user interacts with the extension.
    *   `scripting`: Required to inject scripts into pages to access `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Needs host permissions.
    *   `contextMenus`: Required to add options to the right-click menu.
    *   **Host Permissions:** `<all_urls>`: Required for `cookies` and `scripting` to work on any website the user chooses to save/restore sessions for. Justify this broadly needed permission clearly in the extension's description.
*   **9.5 Project Structure:**
    *   Use a monorepo structure or two separate folders as requested:
        ```
        quick-switch-login/
        ├── extension/      # Browser Extension Code (Manifest V3)

        ```
    *   Ensure code within each part is modular (e.g., separate modules for API calls, storage interaction, UI logic in the extension; separate routes, controllers, models in the backend).

---

## 10. Error Handling & Edge Cases

*   **Network Errors:** Handle failures communicating with the backend (show error message, enable offline mode, retry sync later).
*   **Permission Errors:** If necessary permissions are denied by the user, explain clearly why they are needed. Handle failures if APIs like `chrome.cookies.set` fail due to policy or other restrictions.
*   **Data Extraction/Injection Errors:** Handle cases where `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` access fails (e.g., security restrictions on certain pages). Inform the user if parts of the session couldn't be saved/restored.
*   **Invalid Data:** Handle corrupted local data or unexpected API responses gracefully.
*   **Authentication Errors:** Provide clear feedback for incorrect login credentials, email already exists, etc.
*   **Sync Conflicts:** Implement a basic conflict resolution strategy (e.g., last write wins based on `updatedAt` timestamp) or notify the user about significant conflicts if necessary.
*   **Large Data:** Consider potential limits of `chrome.storage.local` and backend request sizes if users store excessive amounts of data in LS/SS. While no hard limit is set (per Q&A 22), be mindful of browser/API constraints.
*   **Session Limits:** No limit on number of saved sessions (per Q&A 22).

## 12. Agent Instructions

*   **Adherence:** You MUST adhere strictly to the requirements outlined in this PRD. Do not add features not specified, and do not omit required features. This PRD describes the **final product**, not an MVP.
*   **Code Quality:** Implement the solution using clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Follow established best practices for JavaScript, Manifest V3 extension development, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB interaction. Ensure the codebase is modular as specified in the project structure (9.5).
*   **Documentation:** Provide comments in the code for complex logic. Include a `README.md` file for both the `extension/` and `backend/` directories detailing setup instructions, build steps (if any), and an overview of the architecture.
*   **Security Focus:** Pay extreme attention to security aspects, especially authentication, authorization, data validation, and secure communication (HTTPS). Implement password hashing and rate limiting as specified. Acknowledge the user's requirement regarding no encryption at rest but implement all other security measures robustly.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for user-facing feedback and system stability.
*   **Testing:** While not explicitly asked to write tests, structure the code in a way that facilitates testing (e.g., separation of concerns). Ensure manual testing covers all core user flows and edge cases described.
*   **Deliverable:** Provide the complete source code structured as specified, ready for deployment. Ensure all parts (extension, backend) work together as described.
